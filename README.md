# hello-world

Writing something about myself in order to have it included in the readme.md file.  I have a fluffy dog!  Every time someone sees my dog they smile, whether they are a little girl or a burly construction worker, then they say something like, "Fluffy!" (if a little girl) or "I like your dog!" (if a burly construction worker).  Sometimes it's the other way around.
